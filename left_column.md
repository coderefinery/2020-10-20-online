### Registration

<a class="btn btn-warning" href="https://indico.neic.no/event/151/"
data-mode="1" target="_blank">Register (closed to solo learners)</a> -
only open for helpers and existing teams.

Because of our Nordic funding, priority is for Nordic participants.

* **First round is full:** you can use the link above to register as a
  helper or an existing team.  Otherwise, you will be waitlisted.


### Zoom?  Live streaming?  Team?

If you register, you can attend via **Zoom**.  We recommend you get
some friends and register as a **team** - you will be in a breakout
room together for the whole workshop, making it much more fun and
educational.

You can also attend via **live stream** on Twitch: <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>,
see [bottom right on this page](#streaming-info).
Privacy is our first concern and *only* the instructor's video will be
published, and *breakout rooms for exercises are completely private*.


### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices for
**version control and reproducibility** in modern research software development.
The main focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

**We will not teach programming**, but we teach the tools you need to use programming
well.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming language that you
use in your work and research. We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.

This is an informal and interactive online event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.


### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software (see below).
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that Git is configured, and verify the configuration (see below).


### Software requirements

You need to install some software *before* CodeRefinery ([why we ask
you to do
this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page. **You also need to check your Git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).
**If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.**

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  configuring it ([text instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/#configuring-git),
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&t=258s)).
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)
- University computer specific instructions:
  - [Aalto University](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/aalto/coderefinery-setup/)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**


### Schedule

All times are in **Europe/Stockholm time** (note summer time ends
