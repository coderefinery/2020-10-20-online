### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, **join us as a helper**! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus *why not allow
groups to bring their own helper?*:

- We have the concept of **teams** that **bring their own breakout room**.
- Anyone may **register as a learner**, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can **register as a helper**.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with these tools, you can be a helper! (see below)
- **Register as a team**, one helper and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams.
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide some team name, and give this name when registering so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery before and have used git some after
that, you are definitely capable of being a helper.  If you routinely
use git and know Python somewhat well, you are also very qualified to
be a helper.

Helper introduction:

- If you registered as a helper, please join **one** of the following
  two timeslots (Stockholm time):
  - Friday, Oct 16, 09:00 - 10:00 ([time converter](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2020-10-16/09:00/CodeRefinery%20helper%20training#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvZGVyZWZpbmVyeS5naXRodWIuaW8vMjAyMC0xMC0yMC1vbmxpbmUvIn0=))
  - Monday, Oct 19, 15:00 - 16:00 ([time converter](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2020-10-19/15:00/CodeRefinery%20helper%20training#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvZGVyZWZpbmVyeS5naXRodWIuaW8vMjAyMC0xMC0yMC1vbmxpbmUvIn0=))
- During this time, we will talk about the role of the helper during the workshop and answer any open questions
- You can also read through the material [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helper-intro/)
- If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell us apart from these sessions, please...

  - or you can send an email to support@coderefinery.org.
  - write your question [here*](https://hackmd.io/8bLEW1nySgqRglZvbwU_zw) and we will try to answer asap  (the HackMD is a collaborative document (written in markdown), for now the important part to know is that you can add questions there by finding the pen symbol in the top toolbar and write your question under the ##Helper questions header)

- If you want to help or learn how to help with installation issues, please also participate in the installation help sessions which are right after the helper sessions.


### FAQ

- **Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **Am I good enough to be a helper?**  If you are asking this
  question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
  git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
  be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

- **How does the waiting list work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waiting list until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general).

* **If the workshop is streamed/published, will I be visible?**
  Privacy and internal safety is our first concern.  Only instructors
  video will be published.  If you use voice to questions in the main room,
  that might be published.  The most common way to ask questions is
  written, and anyone can feel comfortable using this.  Breakout
  rooms, where all of the hands-on work and most discussion happens,
  are always private and unrecorded.

* **I can't register/didn't make it past the waiting list, and I would
  like to follow the streams myself.**  We don't yet know if we will
  do this or what the format will be.  Please check back for further
  information.  Note, we highly recommend registering as a team if
  possible, you will get much more out of the workshop if you are a
  part of it.

* **Is there any way I can follow along?**  We'll try to live stream
  it, see below.  The experience won't be the same, but we do what we
  can.

* **If it's online, why did you close?**  CodeRefinery workshops are
  interactive, with lots of interaction between instructors, helpers,
  and learners.  We can scale one-to-many easily, but we reached the
  limits of an interactive format.

* **When are registrations approved?**  We will look through number
  of attendees and number of helpers, and accept who we can and direct
  the rest to the live stream.

* **How can I be notified of updates?**  Currently, we don't have any
  way.  Follow [@coderefine](https://twitter.com/coderefine) on
  Twitter.


## Streaming info

We will live stream the course so that those who didn't have a chance
to register can follow along too.  See [the streaming
info to take full advantage](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/#live-streaming).

We will stream at <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  Check/follow
